        I want to be an engineer so my main focus is on my technical side. I had always been bright in the computers in my previous school I had made projects, presentations and had represented my school in interschool competition for computers. I know a tiny bit of JavaScript and I also know html.

    <p style="font-size: 35;color: aliceblue;">
        I like to play badminton, cricket, mindgames, mobile games, minecraft, my most favourite nerf and lego.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 35; color: aliceblue;">
        I also love to read a set of books like Dairy of a wimpy kid, tom gates and I love to learn and test new things in computers.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 35; color: aliceblue;">
        I am very choosy I always think that may the best thing that suits me is with me, so I take hours of deciding what to buy in clothes, footwear and mostly chips.
